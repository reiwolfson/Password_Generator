# Password Generator

## Description

Tasked with creating a password generator that takes into account the user's desired length and if they would like to include lowercase and upper case letters, numbers and special characters. 

## Usage

Click the red "Generate Password" button. Then enter the number of characters you wish the password to contain. Enter your selection as a numeric value. Then confirm if you would like lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers or special characters included by clicking "OK" in the pop up boxes. Password will generate within the dotted box in the center of the screen.
